# ControlWin
ControlWin is application for using gamepads like mouse and keyboard.

Hi, so far this application has not been completed to the end, since only window managers work from the UI elements of the program. so far, you can use it to control the mouse using your controller:

L1 - left mouse button
R1 - left mouse button
Left Stick - moving the mouse

I have a PS 5 controller, so the view of buttons and triggers is copied from it
